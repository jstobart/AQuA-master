----------------------------------

AQuA (**A**strocyte **Qu**antification and **A**nalysis) is a tool to detect signalling events from microscopic time-lapse imaging data of astrocytes or other cell types. The algorithm is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, so, potentially, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, cell types, and imaging resolutions and speeds. If you have any feedback or issue, you can either post issue here or send email to Guoqiang Yu (yug@vt.edu).

# Download and installation
## MATLAB GUI

1. Download latest version **[here](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA/archive/master.zip)**.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Start MATLAB.
4. Switch the current folder to AQuA's folder.
5. Double click `aqua_gui.m`, or type `aqua_gui` in MATLAB command line.

We tested on MATLAB versions later than 2017a. Earlier versions are not supported.

## MATLAB Without GUI
### Use aqua_cmd.m file
1. Double click `aqua_cmd.m` file.
2. Set the folder path 'p0' and target dataset name 'f0'.
3. Run the file.
4. The output files will be saved in a subfolder of 'p0'.

### Use aqua_batch.m file
1. Double click `aqua_batch.m` file.
2. Set the folder path 'p0', and for each target dataset, set the parameters in `AQuA/cfg/parameters_for_batch.csv`. Each dataset is corresponding to one parameter setting.
3. Run the file.
4. The output files will be saved in subfolders of 'p0'.

## Fiji plugin

1. Download **[here](https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA-Fiji/releases)**.
2. Put the downloaded `Aqua.jar` to the plugins folder of Fiji.
3. Open Fiji.
4. In the `Plugins` menu, click `Aqua`.
5. Open movie and choose project path in AQuA GUI.

Some browsers may show a warning when downloading the 'jar' file. Please choose 'keep file'.
Note: The Fiji version do not save the results in 'res' data structure in 'mat' file. If users want to obtain the results and process by themselves, please use MATLAB version.

# Getting started
If you are using AQuA for the first time, please read
**[the step by step user guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vUZP44KG3B4m4LZXfzcauiyp-Sqd0eJ1)**.

Or you can check the **[details on output files, extracted features, and parameter settings](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U3oJpEFwv0lXdax6efSnoifcYjJuRzj3)**.

# Example datasets
You can try these real data sets in AQuA. These data sets are used in the supplemental of the paper.

**[Ex-vivo GCaMP dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13tNSFQ1BFV__42TY0lZbHd1VYTRfNyfD)**

**[In-vivo GCaMP dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TjfFzlg_6BxsFX_l3-P92M5Rp_5j6wiM)**

**[GluSnFr dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XFJBE18sQTa6svXXRV1TidgNPSv-ldtY)**

We also provide some synthetic data sets. These are used in the simulation part of the paper.

# Updates

**10/30/2019:** 

The update adds the random seed and makes the random variables controllable. Now with same parameter setting, AQuA will give same results. (Due to the randomness, the results will have a little difference before.)

**10/19/2019:** 

Repair the bug in Fiji version that 'minimum correlation' in merging step cannot be set to float data.

**10/17/2019:** 

1) The update avoids the error report when nothing is detected for `aqua_batch.m`. 

2) Allow `aqua_batch.m` to read a batch of cell boundaries and landmarks.

**10/16/2019:** 

The update adds the new script `aqua_batch.m` which can let users deal with multiple files. **[MATLAB Without GUI](#matlab-without-gui)** shows how to use it.
